# Science
Eureka D20
Each Science Station and University add 1 point to develop a research die. At 10 you gain a research die (1d6)
Science Center adds 100 science per month
Research center focusing on science provides 200.
Each Research Center may roll up to 1 research die per month from the available research dice pool.(Ex. You have 5 Research die and 2 Research Centers you can roll 2 max every month until you make more) (Player Option: Spend 300 science and 100 industry to choose the outcome of the roll instead of leaving to chance)
1 - gain 1 Science tech
2 - 4 - gain 10 percent toward Research
5 - Gain 15 percent toward Research
6 - advance current research by 25 percent (if no research gain 200 science)
Research centers are limited to 1 for every 15 science centers

Science Centers need 50 Labor to run at full capacity [25 to run at half capacity and can be 0 to not function]

Science center maintenance is 15,000 bits per month
## What does science do?
Provides Science Tech which lets you unlock Science specific Technology

Finds discoveries



## Research Reference Table
Welcome to the Research table where we list out some tech that provides a goal for our players. This is just a reference for our players decisions and can go down a traditional path we saw on earth. If/when players decide to do something different with their scientists time this table can be referenced on how to dictate the effects and cost. This table is what we learned from earth but we are no longer there and if the players decide a different way we can encourage this divergence but at what cost..
