Culture Populance Management - You can influence your culture table roll 
Maintenance of each culture center 10,000 per month

# Science
Eureka D20
Each Science University/Station adds a 1d6
Science Center adds 100 science per month
Research center focusing on science provides 200 and you get to roll 1d6 every month (Spend 300 science and 100 industry to choose reward)
1 - gain 1 tech
2 - 5 nothing
6 - advance current research by 25 percent (if no research gain 200 science)

Science Centers need 50 populance to run at full capacity [25 to run at half capacity and can be 0 to not function]

Science center maintenance is 15,000 per month

## What does science do?
Provides Tech
Develops Research
Develops Populance
Finds discoveries

# Industry
Eureka D20
Each Industry Center adds 100 Industry per month
Research center focusing on industry provides 200 and you get to roll 1d6 every month (Spend 300 science and 100 industry to choose reward)
1 - gain 1 tech
2 - 5 nothing
6 - advance current project by 25 percent (if no project gain 200 industry)

Industry Centers need 100 populance to run at full capacity [50 to run at half capacity and can be 0 to not function]

Industry Center Maintenance is 20,000 per month
Waste produced depends in capacity and project but if running minimum waste is 100 waste
