#### Game Master
The responsibilities of the Game Master in this engine are simple: facilitate the ambitions of the players while creating a memorable experience. As steward of the world, the GM adjudicates mechanics, maintains internal consistency, and applies consequences as fairly as possible.

The world should react naturally to player actions — or inaction. If a leader listens to dissent, the population may grow loyal. If a leader suppresses it, unrest may escalate. The GM may also introduce manufactured chaos to maintain tension, such as random events, faction reactions, natural disasters, or rival nations.

Above all, the GM should ensure the experience is engaging and enjoyable for everyone at the table — including themselves.

#### Player

The players are the primary drivers of the world’s direction. As leaders, your decisions shape society, influence other leaders, and create long-term consequences.

You are encouraged to pursue your ambitions — whether noble, pragmatic, or ruthless — but remember this is a shared experience. Engage with the system, accept the outcomes of your actions, and be mindful that your decisions affect both the world and the other players. The Game Master has final authority in adjudicating outcomes and consequences to preserve consistency and fairness. It is your role to respond to the chain reactions that unfold.

Shared fun requires shared responsibility.
