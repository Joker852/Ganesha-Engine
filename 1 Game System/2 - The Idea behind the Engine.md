# Reflection
I wanted to create an engine (if that is the right term) where it would allow the player to be a head of a nation. I love DnD and I have been DMing for quite some time and I thought it would be fun to give it a try.

I'm using my experience from playing video games, playing board games and play TTRPG to help build this. So there may be some inspirations from the games I've played.

This engine will be a narrative political RPG first then spreadsheet game second.
